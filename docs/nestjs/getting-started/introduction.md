Nest Boilerplate Project is powered by [Nest](https://nestjs.com/)

Please use a template from [README.sample.md](#) for your real project README.md. An example can be found in [README.example.md](#)

## ðŸ“‹ Introduction

Powered by Nest and Typescript, this boilerplate project will make your life easier when setup a new project without worrying too much about the architecture, routing, validation, middleware, ...etc. This boilerplate project can be fully customized to your needs.

Thanks to VSCode and Typescript, we will have a fully intellisense when coding. No more magic function names appear out of nowhere, or some global functions that we have no idea where it is located.

We want to hear your feedback and your suggestion on this project to make it more powerful, robust and dynamic.
