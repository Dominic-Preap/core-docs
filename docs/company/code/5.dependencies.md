The following details how dependencies are managed for a given technology stack.

## Node.js

We use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager instead of `npm` because it has a fast performance speed and cache functionality better than `npm`.

```shell
yarn                                # install all dependency
yarn add [package-name]             # add to dependency
yarn add [package-name] -D          # add to dev dependency
yarn remove [package-name]          # remove from dependency
yarn upgrade-interactive --latest   # update outdated packages
```

In the `package.json` file, the project must have specific version dependency by remove tilde(~) and caret(^) in every dependencies. This will protect the unexpected build failure when one of dependencies get updated. More info on [tilde(~) and caret(^)](https://stackoverflow.com/q/22343224).

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "17.0.0",
    "react-dom": "17.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "17.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "17.0.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react-refresh": "1.3.1",
    "typescript": "4.3.2",
    "vite": "2.3.8"
  }
}
```
