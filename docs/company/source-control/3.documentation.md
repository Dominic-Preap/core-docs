Each project should have a `README.md` in the project's root folder. This should contain at a minimum:

- A brief description of the project, justifying its existence
- How to build the project
- If it is a deployable, how to run it
- If it is a library, a quickstart on how to use it
- If it has an API, a link to more detailed API documentation
