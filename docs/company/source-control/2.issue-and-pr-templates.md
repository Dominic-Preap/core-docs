As developers, our responsibility is not only to fix issues or implement new features, but to clearly communicate the development work to reviewers. A developer can convey proposed code changes and their purposes either through detailed documentation or other means of communication.

Here's where the inevitable descriptions of pull or merge requests come into play, where the code contributors share detailed comments on their code.

## About the Templates

Github templates are the templates in a repository to help contributors create high-quality issues and pull requests. It is a way to ensure every pull request was uniform without our contributors having to think about it. There are two type of templates: [Issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) & [Pull request template](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository).
